# Roadmap
This is what you can expect from future Zircon versions. While Zircon is in no way rivalling [Regolith](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/Regolith), That does not mean it will not experience updates.

Occasionally features from later updates may be introduced earlier and features promised in one update may be introduced later.
